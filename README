== Welcome to HTTP Proxy

This is a Rails 3 HTTP Proxy application.  It allows users to surf the web through a single URL thus either masking their browsing experience or rendering pages in other frames on a page.  Page frames are not able to share content state.  This approach circumvents the browser's security design.

The HTTP page fetches with redirection handling and cookie jar support were inspired by:
http://oldwiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/HowToRenderProxiedPages

You can browse pages with the following URL structure:
http://localhost:3000/proxy?url=http://amazon.com
